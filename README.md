Tips and dots to rice termux. The android terminal emulator.

# Tips and recommendations
These dots will spice up your terminal, place in your home directory. Just make sure to install exa, no-more-secrets, zsh, bat and pfetch!
Btw, you can set your colorscheme using termux's configuration since the theme does not include a font or color, it's mostly powerlevel10k (https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) with my own additions.
